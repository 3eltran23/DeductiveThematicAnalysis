        "*   The set of judges, $J = \\{j_1, \\dots , j_m\\}$, where $m \\geq 2$\n",
        "*   The item label set, $\\mathbf{y^{j_i}} = [ y_{1}^{j_i}, \\dots,  y_{n}^{j_i} ]^T$ is a $n$ dimensional vector with a category label $y_i \\in K$ assigned to the item i for the judge $j_i$\n",

        "Once you have the matrix of proportions of agreement, you can apply the chi-square test to examine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the observed proportions and the proportions expected under the null hypothesis of independence. It is a non-parametric test, meaning it does not assume any underlying data distribution.\n",

While the alternative hypotesis suggest otherwise.\n",
